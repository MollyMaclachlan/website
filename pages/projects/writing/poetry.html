                            The bulk of my writing that you can find on the internet is poetry. It's the first type of creative writing I can ever remember doing, and I don't see myself ever stopping.

                            Most of my poems are available on <a href="https://allpoetry.com/Molly_Maclachlan" target="_blank">my AllPoetry account</a>, though I tend to think that those from before 2022 are pretty bad. Below, you can find six of the poems I'm most proud of. Click on "Read full poem..." to bring up the full thing. Each one has a link to its AllPoetry page at the bottom.

                                                We see them sometimes, at sunrise;<br/>
                                                their skin is pale, their limbs are long.<br/>
                                                They climb up to greet the day, and<br/>
                                                flit along the walls like shadows.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                Eyes red as embers, pupils slit,<br/>
                                                they watch from the trees, lingering<br/>
                                                like ghosts, or reflections, or a<br/>
                                                trick of the sunbeams in the leaves.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                They cannot stand the sound of clocks,<br/>
                                                or the scrape of cars and gravel,<br/>
                                                and they only eat the coldest<br/>
                                                porridge, that's seen all of the night.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                They show their displeasure at dusk,<br/>
                                                in the shattering of windows,<br/>
                                                the shaking of beds, and in the<br/>
                                                torrents of rain and sleet and hail.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                But when all is done right, we wake<br/>
                                                and find the cleaning has been done,<br/>
                                                and a full breakfast set out by<br/>
                                                our neighbours under the doorstep.

                                                and mirrors catch the memories right.

                                                and each I think will surely last<br/>
                                                a year again; they did before.

                                                will outweigh time that's still to come,<br/>
                                                when chances glance the paths not loved,<br/>
                                                you'll fancy sagas sewn thereof.

                                                Never weep for idle moments<br/>
                                                that gather air and draw a breath,<br/>
                                                pacing life like a written word,<br/>
                                                making sense of all those songs you've heard.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                At night I read the clock once more,<br/>
                                                and see its hands are dyed in reds,<br/>
                                                and tell that time is not so vast,<br/>
                                                when all its counts have chimed before.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                I think I know where the years go.<br/>
                                                They're in a box, under my bed.<br/>
                                                Or in a room, inside my head.<br/>
                                                There they'll stay until I want them.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                I'll choose with care the stars I mourn,<br/>
                                                and keep them few and close to me,<br/>
                                                so when dawn lights the sky once more,<br/>
                                                I'll see what new things the day has in store.
                                            </p>

                                                Humans have all but forgotten the yellow silence;<br/>
                                                the silence of eyes that wait and watch in the dark;<br/>
                                                a stillness of two kinds, opposites as much as twins.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                There are those that contrast themselves, twofold;<br/>
                                                gold and orange they are wrapped in so soft a warmth<br/>
                                                that can only exist when white hush drapes the outdoors.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                The gaps between the birdsong are green, I think,<br/>
                                                when the wind drops and nothing moves for a time;<br/>
                                                leaves and flowers hold still, the air paralysed.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                And there is one sort of silence that is just grey;<br/>
                                                when sounds meet the ear, but the mind is elsewhere<br/>
                                                and finds nothing but flickering static on a screen.
                                            </p>

                                                the trees tore up their roots and crawled as one<br/>
                                                off to new lands, brighter of sky and sun. 
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                Fields were trampled, houses battered, rooves grazed,<br/>
                                                yet nothing was hurt, not even a fly;<br/>
                                                when morning woke, the hills were all bald, and<br/>
                                                only rootprints tell of the crowns they wore. 
                                            </p>

                                                in frozen flesh that lie –

                                                and ticking time<br/>
                                                sees not the world fordone.

                                                so lie and sing<br/>
                                                and think of summers seen,<br/>
                                                and all will wane,<br/>
                                                and lightless peace will keen.
