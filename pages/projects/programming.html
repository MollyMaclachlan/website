                                    In addition to everything else on the website, I'm a programmer. I have a Bachelor's degree in software engineering, partially because none of the other things I'm interested in are stable career paths.

                                    I also have a few programming hobby projects. I wrote most of them to help me slightly shorten a task I was carrying out repeatedly, and a few just because I thought it would be interesting. And, of course, this website is one of my programming projects!

                                    I make mods for games I enjoy now and then, as well. Generally pretty simple ones, but mods nonetheless. I always plan to make larger, more complex mods — like a questline for <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elder_Scrolls_III%3A_Morrowind" target="_blank">Morrowind</a></i> I've been planning for, let's say, a while — and then never end up doing so. One day I'll get round to it.

                                    FOSS is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software" target="_blank">free and open-source software</a>, which means that it's licensed in a way that grants users the right to study, change and distribute it and its source code to anyone and for any purpose.

                                    It's my belief that software should be freely available to everyone. Take this website, for example. Its scripts are algorithms; logical progression and sets of instructions. The HTML is just data representation. I don't believe in the ability of anyone to "own" a set of logical intsructions or a specific way of representing data. Thus, this website's software component are released under the AGPLv3 license. (See the <a href="../legal.html">Terms & Conditions</a> page for more detail.)

                                    To further the prevalence of FOSS, I aim to use copyleft licenses as much as possible. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyleft" target="_blank">Copyleft</a> is a technique whereby the continued freedom of derivative software is ensured by requiring that such software use the same license as the original. For example, the AGPLv3 license mentioned above requires, among other things, that if you distribute software from this website, modified or unmodified, or allow users to access it over a network, you must also release the source under AGPLv3.
