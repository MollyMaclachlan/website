                            I've always loved music. Was in choir in secondary school. Fiddle with MuseScore. Sing practically all the time. Probably annoy my neighbours.

                            In terms of things that are public, you've got the <a href="https://ggroupies.bandcamp.com/">GrafeasGroupies</a>, a group consisting of myself and several friends. Together we occasionally make albums consisting of memes and some serious tracks. There's also my cover of 'Mad World', which was included in our second album, <a href="https://ggroupies.bandcamp.com/album/mister-typealot-2">mister TypeALot</a>.

                            I hope to create more proper music videos in the future. It can be difficult considering my lack of skill with instrumentals; I have to rely on YouTube to give good backing tracks, which it can't always be relied upon to do. Nonetheless, I sometimes find excellent ones, such as for 'Mad World', and in these cases I hope to create more recordings good enough to upload.

                            Oh, I also did a little piano thing in MuseScore on a whim one time. It's called 'A Fire Glimmers in the North'.
