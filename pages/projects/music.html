                            I've always loved music. I was in choir in secondary school, I fiddle with MuseScore, and I sing practically all the time.

                        <div class="block">
                            In terms of my public music, you've got the <a href="https://ggroupies.bandcamp.com/">GrafeasGroupies</a>, a group consisting of myself and several friends. Together we made a couple of albums consisting of memes and some slightly more serious tracks. There's also my cover of "Mad World", which was included in our second album, <a href="https://ggroupies.bandcamp.com/album/mister-typealot-2">mister TypeALot</a>.

                            I hope to create more proper music videos in the future. It can be difficult considering my lack of skill with instrumentals; for covers, I have to rely on YouTube to give good backing tracks, which it can't always be relied upon to do. Nonetheless, I sometimes find excellent ones, such as for "Mad World", and in these cases I hope to create more recordings good enough to upload.

                        <div class="block">
                            As mentioned, I also fiddle with MuseScore quite a lot. I did a little piano thing in it on a whim one time. It's called "A Fire Glimmers in the North". Exported MuseScore tracks aren't the best production quality, but they can still sound quite nice, so perhaps I'll make more of them.
