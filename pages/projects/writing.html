                                    Writing: there's nothing I love more. Well, obviously family and friends and so on, but I in terms of activities â€” nothing.

                                    I first became interested in writing during my first year of secondary school, aged 11. I already loved reading, so instead of paying attention to my classes, I began writing blurbs for non-existent books.

                                    After some time, I decided I wanted to make those books existent, and in fourth year, with some advice and encouragement from a truly wonderful English teacher, I first began properly writing and threw myself into the hobby. It was also around then that I joined AllPoetry.com, where I have now published over 80 poems.
