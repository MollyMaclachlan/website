                            Writing: there's nothing I love more. Well, obviously family and friends and so on, but I meant in terms of activities. I first became interested in writing during my first year of secondary school, aged 11. I already loved reading, so instead of paying attention to my classes, I began writing blurbs for non-existent books.

                            After some time, I decided to I wanted to make those books existent, and in fourth year, with some advice and encouragement from my truly wonderful English teacher, I first began properly writing and threw myself fully into the hobby, the intent being that, one day, it can be a career.

                            Poetry. Despite being secondary in my interests, this is actually the first type of writing I ever did, and for the moment the type I have the most published work in. Note that 'published' doesn't mean I'm properly published. It means I published it on the internet. Get off my back. Getting published is hard.

                            Prose writing, especially fantasy and science fiction, is my absolute favourite thing to do. In fact, I've done far more of it than poetry, but only a tiny amount of my work can actually be found anywhere.

                            Though I've finished drafts for both a novel and a novella, written more first chapters than I care to admit, and even locally host a MediaWiki installation to organise my information, I've only once got to a point where I'm happy to publish anything. That thing is an in-progress short story collection, Rooms of the Desolate (see below).

                            With that in mind, I'm currently working on a few longer, thus-unpublished projects. <strong>Infinity's Omega</strong> is the novella I mentioned, a piece of science fiction set towards the end of the universe. I've also started a low fantasy steampunk novel called <strong>The Iron City</strong>, which I began writing for NaNoWriMo 2021 and continued for NaNoWriMo 2022 (both of which I completed!).
