                        internet accounts, accompanied by short explanations of what I generally
                        do with them. I have a number of accounts I consider still in use, although
                        activity may still be infrequent, but many more that are completely inactive.
                        They are listed at the bottom of this page, though there are likely some I've
                        forgotten.

                        I'm on AllPoetry, a large poetry-sharing website, as

                        I joined the site on the 1st of October, 2018, and have been active
                        intermittently ever since.
                        <br><br>
                        This is one of my less active "officially" active accounts at the moment,
                        as although I love poetry and this website with all my heart, I'm focusing
                        much more on prose writing than poetry. I still come back and write a poem
                        or two every now and then, though.

                        <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/users/79190763">MBMaclachlan</a>, to be active,
                        as I intend to return to modmaking there when I have time, and I still maintain and
                        provide supports for those mods I've published.
                        <br><br>
                        My most popular mod on Nexus is a Witcher 3 mod,
                        <a href=https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/4232>No Dismemberments or Finishers</a>,
                        which disables some of the more gratuitously violent aspects of the game, but I'm personally
                        far more invested in my <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/legendofgrimrock2/mods/136">Grimrock</a>
                        <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/legendofgrimrock2/mods/140">imports</a>, bringing enemies
                        from the first game into the second one for use in custom dungeons.

                        don't have much time for video games any more. I'd love to get back to playing them though,
                        especially since I'm a bit of a completionist and there are many achievements I never got and

                        My Tumblr account, <a href="https://murdomaclachlan.tumblr.com/">MurdoMaclachlan</a>, is
                        another that sees significantly less activity than many. It could arguable be classed as
                        completely inactive, but I intend to be active there again at some point, so I'm keeping
                        it in the main list.

                        On Twitch I'm <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/murdomaclachlan">MurdoMaclachlan</a> and I
                        stream various video games, primarily
                        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDxJw61Wisx9-C_wu2JT3GaVCZhcbrn93">Hollow Knight</a>.
                        In the past I've also streamed
                        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDxJw61Wisx8ViAzv0xsu_En00cFrMvuU">Dark Souls</a>,

                        and even

                        <br><br>
                        When time permits, I fully intend to go back to streaming and finish Hollow Knight. I've a bucket list
                        of games to play following that, with Dark Souls III at the top. Streaming is genuinely one of my
                        favourite things I've done.

                        My Twitter account, <a href="https://twitter.com/murdomaclachlan">@murdomaclachlan</a>, probably
                        has the potential to be rather contraversial. Although I do post other things there, it's almost
                        entirely dedicated to politics.
                        <br><br>
                        I do my best not to get into arguments about that with people, but inherently there will be people
                        who see things they disagree with on that account, so stay away if you disagree with me politically
                        and are easily triggered.

                        I have yet to publish anything here, and although I do have several drafts saved, they're

                        I'm on YouTube as
                        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFC6WprQlC7q2pwJEhaCPfA">Murdo Maclachlan</a>.
                        I mainly upload clips from my Twitch streams, usually edited but occasionally not.
                        Most of the content here is Hollow Knight related, but my first two videos are mini Dark
                        Souls challenges I did a while back.
                        <br><br>
                        I can't give you an example video for this channel because YouTube is being a rotten little
                        banana and refusing to embed them.
