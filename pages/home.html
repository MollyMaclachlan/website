                        Welcome my website! Here you'll find information about me, links to and embeds of
                        various things I'm doing across the internet, and whatever other things pop in to
                        my mind that I want to include here.

                        Web design isn't my strong suit, so if this website looks or functions a bit wierd
                        in places, don't judge me too harshly. If you find an issue, feel free to contact
                        me, either through e-mail or by opening an issue on GitHub (links in the footer),
                        and I'll do my best to fix it.
                        <br><br>
                        Bear in mind, also, that this site is still a work in progress. Some sections have
                        barely any content, others perhaps a tad too much. I'm working to iron out the cinks
                        and add more sections. I have a gallery page planned, as well as perhaps some more
                        in-depth details of some of my most active accounts.

                    <p>
                        I am Murdo Maclachlan. I'm a 19-year-old Scottish aspiring author and poet,
                        currently studying for a Bachelor's degree in software engineering. I'm also a hobbyist
                        musician, composing and singing when I find the time, and a
                        <a href="http://localhost/murdo/pages/endeavours.html#transcribing">
                            volunteer content transcriber</a>.
                        <br><br>
                        Despite my degree of choice, I intend to do everything I can to avoid working in
                        computing. I have a great love of fantasy and science fiction and it's been my goal
                        to write both professionally for over 7 years now. More detail on this matter can be
                        found
