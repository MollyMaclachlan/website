                        Transcribing? What's that? Transcribing is accessibility, is what it is! This is something
                        I spend a good portion of my time doing, and I've made good friends doing it as well, so
                        it's very close to my heart. But what is it really? It's not your normal transcribing initiative,
                        such as a large library organising an effort to transcribe old documents; no, it's something
                        quite a lot smaller.
                        <br><br>
                        I'd like to introduce you to the <a href="https://grafeas.org/">Grafeas Group</a>, a small non-profit
                        organisation that runs <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TranscribersOfReddit">r/TranscribersOfReddit</a>,
                        an accessibility initiative to transcribe audio, image and video posts on Reddit for the benefit of
                        people who would not normally have access to them. This lack of access can be due to visual or hearing
                        impairents, slow internet, inconsistency of rendering across Reddit's various official and third-party
                        clients, and more. To help these people, the posts are transcribed into the comments, where they can be
                        accessed either by simply reading, or where necessary, by assisstive technology such as screen readers.
                        <br><br>
                        I've been transcribing with the Grafeas Group for over a year as of July 2021, and I've even used a few
                        transcriptions myself in the past when the contrast between the text and the background of images didn't
                        suit my colour vision (I have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_blindness#Protanomaly">protanomaly</a>).
                        <br><br>
                        The two things I love most about transcribing with the Grafeas Group are; first of all, the friends I've
                        made, as they're genuinely some of the best and nicest people I know; and secondly, the kind comments I
                        receive on transcriptions. It's a wonderful thing to know you've actually helped someone, so whenever
                        anyone thanks me or says my transcription helped them enjoy the post, it puts a smile on my face. I also
                        enjoy moderating the subreddit, which I've done since February 2021. Applying for that post was one of the
                        best decisions I've ever made; it introduced me to more wonderful people and allowed me to help out even more.
                        <br><br>
                        I could talk for hours about transcribing and the Grafeas Group, but it's probably already sounding like
                        an advert. Biased as I may be, I do genuinely believe they're one of the best communities on the internet!
                        At over 8,000 transcriptions, I have no intention of stopping soon.

                    <p>
                        Writing: my greatest passion in life, and hopefully one day my career. I first became somewhat
                        interested in writing during my first year of secondary school, at age 11. Already a lover of reading,
                        I began writing blurbs for non-existant books instead of paying attention to my classes. After
                        some time, this developed into wanting to make these books existant, and after I began properly
                        writing for the first time in fourth year, with some advice and and encouragement from my truly
                        wonderful English teacher, I threw myself fully into the hobby, with the full intention of it
                        becoming a career.
                        <br><br>
                        Over time I've written more first chapters than you might think, and I believe beginnings have
                        become for me the easiest part of a story. I have many stories with a rough plan, and one that I've
                        written through several full drafts of. The hardest part for me these days is deciding what to write
                        first. The novel I've fully drafted, a high-fantasy novel tentatively titled <i>A Daemon's Influence</i>,
                        is not currently my main focus. That may be surprising, considering it's the only thing I've written
                        to completion thus far, but I've discovered it will take a lot more careful planning to make as good
                        as it can be, and so in the mean time I decided to work on something shorter.
                        <br><br>
                        After realising that <i>A Daemon's Influence</i> was not going to be the first prose work I published,
                        I moved on to thinking about other ideas. I've written several chapters of a gothic low-fantasy novel
                        entitled <i>A Lady in Black</i>, and have the majority of my plans for the low-fantasy steampunk stories,
                        <i>The Faces of Undertown</i> and <i>The Iron City</i> written out, but in August 2021 an idea occurred
                        to me that I didn't want to let slip away. And thus, the apocalyptic far-future science fiction novella
                        <i>Infinity's Omega</i> was born.
                        <br><br>
                        <i>Infinity's Omega</i> is the first science fiction prose I've ever written, as well as the first novella.
                        I'm in the late stages of the first draft currently, and I've found that the shorter story format allowed
                        for much tighter writing and an easier time plotting out a full plan before even setting the firt word
                        to paper. In terms of George R.R. Martin's metaphor of the Two Types of Writer, I suppose this makes
                        me a full architect just this once, where normally I'm an archtitectural gardener.
                        <br><br>
                        I hoped to finish the first draft of <i>Infinity's Omega</i> before returning to university for my
                        second year, but I've since seen this won't be possible. That's partially my fault for spontaneously
                        deciding to write a website, but hey! I wanted to. I'll still be finishing the draft soon anyway, and
                        that's what really matters.
                        <br><br>
                        Outside of prose, I also write poetry. All of my best, and some of my worst, works are available at my
                        <a href="https://allpoetry.com/Murdo_Maclachlan">AllPoetry</a> account. I opened this account not expecting
                        to do much with it, as I wasn't great at poetry at the time. However, the website quickly took a special
                        place for me. It's one of my favourite websites, honestly, and it makes me sad how little time I get to
                        write for it these days, because the feedback of other writers there really helped me improve my craft.
                        Since my humble beginnings on the site, I've had 12 front page picks, a number which I'm not sure is
                        particularly impressive, but it makes me happy.
                        <br><br>
                        What makes me happiest about AllPoetry, however, is that in February 2020, I officially became a published
                        poet, with my haiku <i>Bitter Cold Teeth</i> making it into one of the website's anthologies,
                        <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Dreaming-Ink-Various/dp/B084Z3WWFH"><i>Dreaming of Ink</i></a>. I love
                        haiku, a type of Japanese poem that I first came across on AllPoetry, and I'm still very proud of that one.
                        Another poem to note on my account is <i>Sea of Night</i>, which, thanks to a very kind Redditor, is currently
                        on an SSD that
                        <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/l52iym/you_can_send_something_to_the_moon_for_free_im/">
